Someone should tell the Politicians that without small business the economy will tank and small business cannot afford to wait months for an arbitrary decision from whatever ego-tripping so called expert shouts loudest.I suspect that many businesses have days or at most a few weeks to recover and if they go down they could very well take the Country with them. An early decision must be made as to when to resume normal working or as near as possible under the circumstances.

In fact in the UK according to our dutiful puppets in the NHS administration people don&#39;t die of anything else anymore! Hit by a car? Well if they test you and you have Flu Antibodies then sorry but your Death Certificate will say you died of COVID-19 and the insanely stupid media will report it as such because today even the media are not fit for purpose as they no longer investigate and then report. They simply get information handed to them which they don&#39;t bother checking and just print.<br><br>We are dealing with a Permanent Government that only in 2001 slaughtered over 13 million livestock because the same old places like The Imperial College of London told them that although only 1% of that population had suffered with Foot and Mouth and although the disease is 100% curable the answer was a Animal Holocaust and then to burn the carcasses on a Pyre so the disease would catch in farms over 30 miles away and that&#39;s exactly what they did. Of course the numbers suddenly stopped, at least according to the not fit for bog roll media, the very same month Blair was up for Re-election. Talk about convenient right? And do you know how much that cost the taxpayer? Over ¬£200 billion and they gave the famers affected including the 69 or so farmers who committed suicide ¬£1.8 billion across over 9000 farms! <br><br>So was Foot and Mouth real? It is a real disease yes however it is curable but the Permanent Government were given an EU directive and that was to weaken the UKs agriculture by any means necessary because the EU wants the UK to be the hub of Finance and Tourism which i&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree are totally useless things in a crisis however it would make the UK a lot more dependent on the EU for its produce.

"Dr John Ioannidis, Professor in diseases prevention, Professor of medicine, of health research and policy (epidemiology)  -  ‚ÄúThe biggest problem with covid 19 is the lack of reliable data. Numbers are incorrect, estimates are too high. Other types of Corona virus‚Äô have infected millions of people and killed thousands. But only in the case of Covid 19 does the media raise the alarm with every infection and every death.<br><br>An imparting factor is age. Old people are at higher risk, younger people are at a much lower risk and children run hardly any risk at all. Every winter, the flu kills large numbers of elderly people, that‚Äôs normal. That‚Äôs why the mortality rate in Italy is high - Italy has the oldest population in europe and one of the oldest in the world. The average age (of people who‚Äôve died) is 81!<br><br>The stories about Italian hospitals that cannot handle the amount of patients or the crematoriums that can‚Äôt handle the amount of bodies, are not true. Only a few Italian cities are having problems, and in those cities not all hospitals are having problems.<br><br>And that can be explained by bad decisions and a structural shortage of ICU‚Äôs. As soon as the first sick people were brought in, it was decided to put them in the ICU‚Äôs. That‚Äôs how they created a problem that they later regretted: the ICU beds were taken once the infection wave began.<br><br>Italy always had a very high percentage of people who smoked. This is why every winter the ICU‚Äôs are filled with people with severe respiratory diseases. ‚Äú<br><br>~<br><br>Dr John Ioannidis, Professor in diseases prevention, Professor of medicine, of health research and policy (epidemiology) of statistics and of Biomedical Data Science.

"Four German holidaymakers who were illegally quarantined in Portugal after one was judged to be positive for Covid-19 have won their case, in a verdict that condemns the widely-used PCR test as being up to 97-percent unreliable.<br>Earlier this month, Portuguese judges upheld a decision from a lower court that found the forced quarantine of four holidaymakers to be unlawful. The case centred on the reliability (or lack thereof) of Covid-19 PCR tests.<br><br>The verdict, delivered on November 11, followed an appeal against a writ of habeas corpus filed by four Germans against the Azores Regional Health Authority. This body had been appealing a ruling from a lower court which had found in favour of the tourists, who claimed that they were illegally confined to a hotel without their consent. The tourists were ordered to stay in the hotel over the summer after one of them tested positive for coronavirus in a PCR test - the other three were labelled close contacts and therefore made to quarantine as well.<br><br>Tested positive? There could be as little as a 3% chance it‚Äôs correct <br>This is not the first challenge to the credibility of PCR tests. Many people will be aware that their results have a lot to do with the number of amplifications that are performed, or the ‚Äòcycle threshold.‚Äô This number in most American and European labs is 35‚Äì40 cycles, but experts have claimed that even 35 cycles is far too many, and that a more reasonable protocol would call for 25‚Äì30 cycles. (Each cycle exponentially increases the amount of viral DNA in the sample).<br><br>Earlier this year, data from three US states ‚Äì New York, Nevada and Massachusetts ‚Äì showed that when the amount of the virus found in a person was taken into account, up to 90 percent of people who tested positive could actually have been negative, as they may have been carrying only tiny amounts of the virus.<br><br>The Portuguese judges cited a study conducted by ‚Äúsome of the leading European and world specialists,‚Äù which was published by Oxford Academic at the end of September. It showed that if someone tested positive for Covid at a cycle threshold of 35 or higher, the chances of that person actually being infected is less than three percent, and that ‚Äúthe probability of‚Ä¶ receiving a false positive is 97% or higher.‚Äù<br><br>While the judges in this case admitted that the cycle threshold used in Portuguese labs was unknown, they took this as further proof that the detention of the tourists was unlawful. The implication was that the results could not be trusted. Because of this uncertainty, they stated that there was &quot;no way this court would ever be able to determine&quot; whether the tourist who tested positive was indeed a carrier of the virus, or whether the others had been exposed to it.",20210308,DailyMail

"But deaths remain flat at about 5-10 per day. Cases have been steadily rising since mid-july, but deaths have not. Apart from the 8th of September deaths have been below 20 a day for the last 2 months and below 10 a day for the last week. The last time we had this many cases, there were 400-500 deaths a day. Something has radically changed since April. Whether these new cases translate into new hospitalisations, is yet to be seen. So far it hasn&#39;t for the last 2 months. It could be young healthy people getting mild cases like any common cold &amp; shaking it off quickly. It could just be more testing showing up more infections. It could be higher levels of vitamin D in the population because it is summer (a national programme to give everyone over 50 a daily dose of vitamin D3 &amp; zinc would take a lot of strain off the NHS in winter). But the fact remains that increasing cases, isn&#39;t leading to increasing deaths. And as winter approaches we usually expect increasing seasonal deaths.<br>Ironically the ¬£100bn Boris wants to spend on &#39;testing&#39; would be enough money to put 4kw of solar PV &amp; 4.2kWh of batteries into 20 million households (there are only 27 million households in the UK) - thereby wiping out &#39;Fuel Poverty&#39; at a stroke, and saving the 30,000 excess deaths every single winter.

"For those who missed it, here is a summary of the new government guidelines :<br><br>1) everyone is awesome and thanks to the government we only have the second highest number of coronavirus deaths to date. Well done everyone. <br><br>2) we have the first sketch of a road map. The new alert level system has 5 levels. We are currently between levels 3 and 4.<br><br>3) to move to level 3 we need to be testing hundreds of thousands of people every day. We&#39;re miles from the target we said we would be hitting, one hundred thousand tests per day. So we&#39;re at level 4.<br><br>4) &quot;we will pick it up where it strikes&quot;. <br><br>5) the rate of infection (R) is below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 but potentially only just below 1.<br><br>6) No. This is not the time to end the lockdown. <br><br>7) Anyone who can&#39;t work from home should be actively encouraged to go to work but should avoid public transport if possible. <br><br>8) From Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take unlimited amounts of exercise, like sitting on park benches or driving. You can even play sports, but only with members of your own household. <br><br>9) increased fines for anyone not following these very clear guidelines. <br><br>10) if you behave and the virus plays nice, we might be able to open some shops and schools after half-term. <br><br>11) in July, or later, subject to a number of unspecified conditions, we will hope to open at least some public places, if they&#39;re safe.<br><br>12) it will soon be the time to impose quarantine on people entering the country. <br><br>13) a long list of amazing and underpaid and undervalued people... <br><br>14) we&#39;ve got a plan but if things don&#39;t go to plan, &quot;we&#39;ll simply wait and go on until we&#39;ve got it right&quot;.<br><br>15) stay alert, control the virus and save lives.<br><br>So, now that&#39;s clear.",20200510,BBC

"The Rules (Are you ready?):<br>1. Basically, you can&#39;t leave the house for any reason, but if you have to, then you can.<br>2. Masks are useless, but maybe you have to wear one, it can save you, it is useless, but maybe it is mandatory as well.<br>3. Stores are closed, except those that are open.<br>4. You should not go to hospitals unless you have to go there. Same applies to doctors, you should only go there in case of emergency, provided you are not too sick.<br>5. This virus is deadly but still not too scary, except that sometimes it actually leads to a global disaster.<br>6. Gloves won&#39;t help, but they can still help.<br>7. Everyone needs to stay HOME, but it&#39;s important to GO OUT.<br>8. There is no shortage of groceries in the supermarket, but there are many things missing when you go there in the evening, but not in the morning. Sometimes.<br>9. The virus has no effect on children except those it affects.<br>10. Animals are not affected, but there is still a cat that tested positive in Belgium in February when no one had been tested, plus a few tigers here and there‚Ä¶<br>11. You will have many symptoms when you are sick, but you can also get sick without symptoms, have symptoms without being sick, or be contagious without having symptoms. Oh, my God.<br>12. In order not to get sick, you have to eat well and exercise, but eat whatever you have on hand and it&#39;s better not to go out, well, but no‚Ä¶<br>13. It&#39;s better to get some fresh air, but you get looked at very wrong when you get some fresh air, and most importantly, you don&#39;t go to parks or walk. But don‚Äôt sit down, except that you can do that now if you are old, but not for too long or if you are pregnant (but not too old).<br>14. You can&#39;t go to retirement homes, but you have to take care of the elderly and bring food and medication.<br>15. If you are sick, you can&#39;t go out, but you can go to the pharmacy.<br>16. You can get restaurant food delivered to the house, which may have been prepared by people who didn&#39;t wear masks or gloves. But you have to have your groceries decontaminated outside for 3 hours. Pizza too?<br>17. Every disturbing article or disturbing interview starts with &quot; I don&#39;t want to trigger panic, but‚Ä¶&quot;<br>18. You can&#39;t see your older mother or grandmother, but you can take a taxi and meet an older taxi driver.<br>19. You can walk around with a friend but not with your family if they don&#39;t live under the same roof.<br>20. You are safe if you maintain the appropriate social distance, but you can‚Äôt go out with friends or strangers at the safe social distance.<br>21. The virus remains active on different surfaces for two hours, no, four, no, six, no, we didn&#39;t say hours, maybe days? But it takes a damp environment. Oh no, not necessarily.<br>22. The virus stays in the air - well no, or yes, maybe, especially in a closed room, in one hour a sick person can infect ten, so if it falls, all our children were already infected at school before it was closed. But remember, if you stay at the recommended social distance, however in certain circumstances you should maintain a greater distance, which, studies show, the virus can travel further, maybe.<br>23. We count the number of deaths but we don&#39;t know how many people are infected as we have only tested so far those who were &quot;almost dead&quot; to find out if that&#39;s what they will die of‚Ä¶<br>24. We have no treatment, except that there may be one that apparently is not dangerous unless you take too much (which is the case with all medications). <br>25. We should stay locked up until the virus disappears, but it will only disappear if we achieve collective immunity, so when it circulates‚Ä¶ but we must no longer be locked up for that?",20200416,SUN

"Looking at data here in America, more people have died from the common flu, over 1,000 people a year, the children&#39;s cancer hospital lose more lives then this Corona Virus. But no outrage, America is bringing out the national guard stopping people on the New York,  NewJersy turnpike, this has been tried before, our Democracy has slowly been taking away, I think there is a more sinister agenda going on and it has nothing to do with this Virus, All the people that even question these numbers are labeled conspiracy theorists, there have other viruses that have killed much, much more people then this virus but yet none of our freedoms have been taking away. A lot of good people have been duped before, I  believe in History repeats itself over and over. Now here in America the National Guard is stopping people asking question like where are you going where have you been checking their ID, something doesn&#39;t smell right. The most decorated U.S. Marine Smedly Butler warned us, in fact he stopped a take over of our Democracy of the corrupt rich and one of those people was Bush, yes president Bush&#39;s grand father, a trader to America, when President Kennedy was assasinated another Bush was there, when young John Jr. KENNEDY WAS MURDERED ANOTHER Bush was the in power, when 911 happened another Bush was now the President, I don&#39;t believe in coincidence when the same name keeps appearing, this is all run by our own government the CIA, I  believe  this is another attempt at freedom, of course any one that question these unusual circumstances is a conspiracy theorists, you must agree or you will be under attack. The President  question this whole virus theory and he was attracted as if he was a moron.<br>I think he was threatened and by the next week he was making excuses of why he now believes in the virus..There is something that smells quite not right. This was tried after 911 to bring out the National guard but it was stopped by some dedicated American&#39;s. <br>Americans that still believe in What America stands for. Freedom which has been slowly chipped away at and the agenda of the Military Industrial complex once again should be questioned. I don&#39;t like what&#39;s  happening, all I  hear is YOU MAY NOT SHOW SYMPTOMS, which means there nothing there, and never question these so called expert&#39;s.  I believe this is how the Nazi party started, a pack of lies then martial law. I&#39;m  telling you to keep you guns clean, thank God America  still has its second amendment for now, even when it&#39;s been under attack after 911. I&#39;m a  old military man using this email because the person doesn&#39;t know, because I am way too old to lose my prestige. But for you younger Americans please do your research, everything I&#39;ve mentioned here is fact. Beware of martial law, that&#39;s the beginning of the end. Hopefully there are some loyalists here and abroad, they try to destroy Britain, but failed, because of the loyalists of Great Britain. Remember they tried to take your country by making the Brits fall under European financial guide lines, making great Britain change their monetary notes, which was their shot across the bail, please don&#39;t believe everything you hear. There should be some common sense questions, and never take governments word at first value. Questions and more questions. Remember read between the line. They wants you to believe everything they say, and I  can&#39;t believe a word my government says since  the lies of 911.",20200316,Independent

"Alright, EVERYONE has to agree with me here.<br>I understand they want to make everything normal ASAP, but like, on March 8th? Worst possible time. We also have to wear masks at all times (6-8 hours a day) with no mask break? AND on top of that, EVERY student is getting tested twice a week, with a quick test I&#39;m assuming (which isn&#39;t even accurate) so basically what I&#39;m saying here is that it&#39;s worse to have the schools open than to have them closed. I understand parents, key workers and people at home are struggling a lot right now, but for gods&#39; sake, it&#39;s a global pandemic. Also masks last 2 hours max, so that means like, 3-4 masks per day, which is a waste, and also they are quite expensive. I honestly thought Bojo would keep them closed, but he decides to do like, the WORST decision and opens them. I don&#39;t really see what the problem is. Those students who aren&#39;t doing their work, send them in, if they don&#39;t have anybody to look after them at home, send them in, or if they just want to go back to school, send them in. Not everybody is struggling. Everyone shouldn&#39;t have to go in as a whole.
