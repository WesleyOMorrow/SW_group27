Nice speech ? The appreciation of the efforts of people and the thoughts and condolences for people who have lost people to the virus was a nice sentiment<br><br>HOWEVER -<br>I picked up on several key points during the speech that emphasise the plan to monitor and track everyone<br>He said &quot;although we have a plan it is a conditional plan&quot; <br><br>The importance of using Data to stay on top of the virus ? ( and our privacy)<br><br>Levels 1 to 5 alerts which fundamentally was used to install fear amongst people to accept whatever the government told you during the 9/11 period which was followed by the &quot;Weapons&quot; of mass destruction campaign<br><br>He said it will be a necessity to continue to monitor the virus and we will all need to be part of the continued war against the virus<br><br>And tighter controls on people entering the uk . To prevent a re spike of the virus happening<br><br><br>All sounds good on paper ! But !<br><br>I can&#39;t help thinking tat the speech that offered nuggets of hope and &quot;ifs&quot; it was merely a preparation to acclimatise all of us to the next phase of the conditional plan which may ( i think WILL) introduce the reopening of business . Going back to work . Going on holidays overseas. Life insurance . Etc........providing you download and use there monitoring and tracking app of all of us.<br><br>Which obviously forces you by leverage to give up your rights to privacy and data protection because you have no choice if you wish to Work .Travel or go back to normal life again<br><br>JUST A THOUGHT ?,20200510,Independent

Trust in GOD and don&#39;t listen to lies or scaremongering tactics .. stay at home if you suspect you are infects and try to wear a mask to prevent others getting sick in your household.. if you have hard time breathing call 111 follow the directions they give you. You will need to visit the hospital if your symptoms get worse DONT STAY AT HOME IF YOU ARE VERY SICK!!!... apply common sense and you will be fine.

The unemployment will be epic and they cannot allow the economy to start yet because the banks liquidity is desperate so they come up ways to continue this Covid crisis by making it seem like they are trying by creating plausible tactics when in fact it just requires one tactic ie keep shut  down going until its eradicated and then people can trust the safety and thus  open fully the economy.

"PROJECT FEAR, NO PEOPLE DYING as admissions are on a flat curve and hospotals are empty , so are most testing centres. <br>PEOPLE ARE TESTING POSITIVE AS THERE IS A INCREASE IN TESTING because of track and trace and work based or related testing. CASES ARE SUSPECTED ONLY. Track and Tracing game,  LYERS.<br>There is a spike in testing by appointment to tell us how busy it is, now they have run out of tests, really? They are finding people which are IMMUNE and those with a COLD, as they are testing for trace, particles of viral DNA, RNA, which all people have if they had a flu vacc-ine or were ill in  some point in their lifes, more cases are not more ill with COVID and or infected or people DYING WITH or OFF COVID. <br>The CPR TESTS they using are NOT meant for testing viral infection either,<br>And 80% UNRELIABLE.<br>ONLY a BLOOD TESTING would find THAT ELLUSIVIRUS, which seems very INTELLIGENT all through the plandemic, and  need finding with £100 million in a healthy population with a good working immune system. What spikes? those tested forr fake track and fake trace, or those having to test over and over with mixed results, but still having to quarantine, or those with any RNA trace or any of the 37 strains of Corona trace, All positive. <br>And not to forget those people which death certificate was altered to justify death cases equally those that died in the carehome fiasco or those that died of influenza, cancer,  heart attacks, and motorcycle accidents, OFF covid or WITH, is    the twisted narrotive here. Can you smell the coffee now?<br><br>The fantastic immune system,  Fresh Air and sun light, Healthy eating and some Exercise are the best remedies agsinst pathogens and infections.<br>Science have not even isolated this dangerous virus which need finding still, at a spending of £100 million 99.6 rate of  survival and recovery and most people do not even get sick. In the USA they had to review, the amount of people directly dying to WITH cvid. 6% of the original OFF Covid narrative. <br>Absolutely disgusted, my guess is, that we are all being deceived beyond any measure.  Where was i?<br>100 000 people which they claimed ill, and 60.000  died or both, revised to 00.6%. 6000 people, and on a population of over 320 million people. 6000 people that is, really low.  <br>Most if not all of them that did die, were old and vanurable, and those with other underlying health conditions. All other suspected deaths are symptom based diagnosis and suspected on symptoms, such as changing peoples death certificate as<br>THERE IS NO TEST TO FIND covid 19 which was bio engineered to cause global reset. <br>TEST FINDS TRACE OF DNA AND RNA of ANY group of viruses INCLUDING DEATH OR BROKEN TRACE PARTICLES.<br>Virus is still to be isolated, so if still in existence without herd immunity, it  effects only up to 10% of those people with underlying health conditions and the elderly, nothing different than influenza that effects millions of people the world over. <br><br>There is now herd immunity i presume  after 8 months or are all those restrictions pushing for more devision amongst the people?<br>What do you think? I think both.<br><br>Viral infections can and should be treated with HCQ, Hydroxychloroquine and Zinc. A study in Belgium in August 2020 concluded in a study of over 8000 participants that when given the corect dose of 200mg to 400mg per 24 hours, it stated that it will have great benefit even after 5 days, 27%. Less mortality and  more patients recovered cured. Other test done were in the Netherlands and Brazil with Oxford University and the WHO had their own study. Giving way to high of a testing dose 2000mg in 16 Hours, it causes heart problems when given incorrect. On basis of the complications the WHO advised against the use , as there was no evidence that it worked. Absolutely  disturbing that the Belguim study was not observed and acted upon with proving no more then what is the legal gold standard 200mg to 400mg per 24 hours. More recent  testing studies revealed higher recovery and lower mortalitt more than 70% cured. All cases to treat with Hydroxychloroquine and zinc.  Banned in some countries to be described, bu it is a very good and cheap generic medicine and has a extremely  reliable track record for over 70 years of treating anti viral infections, there are several other antiviral treatments that are very effective, reliable and very cheap to manufacture.  Around the world the GOVS are pushing for a reset with several different vac-cines.<br><br>THESE RNA VACCINES are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ANY JAB YOU EVER HAD. The problem?  <br>These are different for all  the wrong reasons. DNA ALTERING, ABORTED Female BABY FOETUS CELL LINES, HECK 293, vaccines are Not TESTED PROPERLY and over time, NANO TECH, MICROCHIP,  could be a big killer and make many ill when mixed with other random untested potions  with many added evils. <br>Many complication expected, including mutations Do not take at any cost, i plead with you in Jesus Christ mighty name. Amen.<br><br>With mind controll and media they will create more and more new normals. Being unable to buy or sell without the mark of the beast. exclusion from society, inducing guilt, financial punishments and imprisonment will be the norm for those that stand, BUT I SAY TO YOU, STAND FOR JESUS CHRIST ONLY, as all other roads lead to destruction.<br><br>Only one study with children suggested that school aged children are up to 5x more likely to get a Corona viral infection after taking a influenza vaccine. Bit concerning as they are pushing all people to get the flu jab. Gov is bringing in new laws for having to accept the unsafe vac-cines and NO LIABILITY when these are given to the general  population There would be load more cases and people testing positive -false positives, and more cases that is   and<br><br>Some People will have more serious symptoms from mixing Vaccines.  In adults there were no studies on these effects, Could be better, could be worse. I love science, that of truth<br>but these particular cases would give the NWO, or WHO all the cloud to act the saviour and bring in the corrupted vaccines to protect us against the  covd2 which they are going to find soon with £100 million <br><br>These ventilators they used in the beginning of the year were set up for a different condition and were putting to much pressure on the longs of patients resulting in more deaths..There was no need for forced sedation in most cases if treated with antiviral drug which was ignored or withheld on advise of fake scientists and experts working for satan himself.<br><br>Care homes were receiving ill, and patients in recovering and there was no testing of care staff till three months into the events.  That lead to people dying there, as there was no propper  protection or plan. Smells a bit fishy to me.  Every week the narrative changed on computer science data and computer predictions based on AI, which has already become a idol of its own. <br><br>FLATTEN THE CURVE, ALL FLAT NOW, WHAT? MORE MEASURES AND LESS FREEDOM?<br>It just proves that Science is not ultimate truth and those believing or shall i say playing for God and abusing the moral laws, are fulfilling bible prophecy.<br><br>Are you all asleep to see that this whole thing is about bringing in the new normal.  <br>Type in go-ogle search any two,three or four numbers and write, new cases,  behind the numbers.

"\"When considering issues like viruses, I like to return to a concept called &quot;first principles&quot;.

Darwin and others referred to it as &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.<br>Somewhere along the line humans decided that they knew better than nature. I suppose out of a sense of compassion some decided that we should try to eliminate disease. When one looks at man&#39;s record however, it has proven to be a dismal failure.
